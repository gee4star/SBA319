#This application is a classic movie picker
##The languages and technologies are MongoDB, Express, and Node.js
### Difficulties include: ensuring the program runs without errors
### Difficuties with delete route, first methods tried didn't work
### If I had more time I would add more categories like movie genre and languages movie is spoken in 
### The Post route creates the movie info 
### For the Get route, all the movie info is listed
### The Put route updates the list
### The Delete route deletes chosen information
